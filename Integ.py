This program is the reference implementation of the Integ language.

In Integ, the only datatype is the integer. The variables have consecutive addresses in Integ (they may or may not be consecutive in memory) and do not get distinct names. Instead,
they are accessed with the notation {x and written to with the notation }xy where x is the address number and y is the new integer. y is optional;
the program will write 0 to x if y is empty.

Variables are declared in two ways; the variable is always initialized at the same time. 
The first declaration method, explicit declaration, occurs simply when a program tries to write to a previously unused address.
So, for instance, a program evaluating }(1)() when storage for address 1 has not yet been allocated will set aside storage for address 0 and set it equal to 0.
Similarly, a program evaluating }(5)(7) will set aside storage for address 5 and set it equal to 7.

In the second case: 

0 1 2 3 4 5
          ^
          7     

The second declaration method, implicit declaration, occurs when a program tries to set aside storage for an address that has empty positions between it and the
nearest address. For instance, a program evaluating }(5)(7) will not just set aside storage for address 5 and set it equal to 7, but also, if the nearest declared address
is 3, set aside storage for 4 and set it equal to 0.

To embed anything inside an operator, use (x). For example, }({(1))() will read from location 1 and write 0 at the location at one's contents. (x) is not counted
as an operator, but as a syntax feature (or something; I don't know).

Note that addresses cannot be read from unless they have been declared.
Also note that address numbers must be greater than or equal to 0.

Integer constants exist in Integ.

Things can be added and subtracted with + and -, and multiplied and divided with * and /.

To print characters, use ]x. This operator prints a numeric code equal to the value of its contents.
To input a character code from the standard input, use [x. Note that [x does not wait for a newline,
and that its implementation may be platform dependent. As a result, this code may not work perfectly
on non-Windows platforms.

The conditional operator is of the form ?xyz. If x is 0, y will be evaluated; otherwise,
z will be evaluated.

The loop operator is of the form ~xy. While x is 0, y will be evaluated.

All operators must have one constitutent character, with the operands following in parentheses.
The character used must be distinct from all other operators' characters."""
